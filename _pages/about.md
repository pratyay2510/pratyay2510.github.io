I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/), where I work as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Bir Bhanu](https://www.ee.ucr.edu/~bhanu/). My research lies at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, and **Physics-based Modeling**.

My current work focuses on developing novel computational frameworks that bridge physics and deep learning. I am building **anisotropic heat diffusion algorithms** for Vision Transformer architectures that enable gradient-aware information flow for event-based data, formulating a stacked routing mechanism that surpasses existing state-of-the-art by ~2.5% on event-based object detection. I am also working on **latent diffusion-guided feature inpainting** for generalized de-occlusion in downstream tasks such as segmentation, object detection, and person re-identification.

Previously, I developed a **Virtual Cloth Try-off** system using Stable Diffusion and Flux-Kontext, mapping images of clothed individuals to flat-lay garment representations. I also built robust **image inpainting** pipelines combining instance segmentation (SAM + DINO) with ControlNet-finetuned Stable Diffusion. My work on **parts-based occlusion-aware person re-identification** (POANet) was published in IEEE TBIOM 2025.

Before joining UCR, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata, India (GPA: 9.5/10). During my undergraduate years, I held research internships at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) (Canada) and [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://www.vcu.edu/) (USA), working on predictive modeling for chess education and multi-vaccine distribution optimization, respectively.

My broader research interests include diffusion models, person re-identification, re-ranking, uncertainty quantification, latent feature reconstruction, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and vision-language models.
