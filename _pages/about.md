I specialize in computer vision, deep learning, and physics-based modeling. My research focuses on designing algorithms that learn effectively from data and bridge physical principles with neural networks.

I aim to push the boundaries of robust and interpretable AI by collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and contributing solutions that impact real-world vision tasks, from person re-identification to event-based perception.
